# Security Policy

## Overview

MediMetrics implements multiple layers of security controls to protect sensitive medical data. This document outlines our security architecture and practices.

## Security Controls

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication using signed JWTs stored in HttpOnly cookies
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Four roles with granular permissions
  - ADMIN: Full system access
  - RADIOLOGIST: Clinical access with PHI visibility
  - TECHNOLOGIST: Operational access, limited PHI
  - CLIENT: Read-only access, redacted PHI
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: TOTP-based 2FA (optional, can be enabled per user)
- **Session Management**: Automatic session expiry and refresh token rotation

### Data Protection

#### Encryption at Rest
- **Database**: Field-level encryption for sensitive columns using AES-256-GCM
- **Object Storage**: Server-side encryption for S3 buckets
- **Key Management**: KEK/DEK pattern with environment-based master keys

#### Encryption in Transit
- **TLS 1.3**: All external communications (configure reverse proxy)
- **Internal TLS**: Optional for service-to-service communication

#### PHI Protection
- **Minimization**: Store only necessary PHI fields
- **Pseudonymization**: Patient IDs replaced with pseudonyms
- **Redaction**: Automatic PHI redaction in logs and API responses
- **Audit Trail**: Complete access logging with redacted payloads

### Access Controls

- **Signed URLs**: Short-lived presigned URLs for S3 access (5-minute TTL)
- **CSRF Protection**: Token validation on state-changing operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-endpoint throttling (configurable)
- **IP Allowlisting**: Optional IP restrictions (configure in reverse proxy)

### Network Security

- **Network Segmentation**: Services isolated in Docker networks
- **Firewall Rules**: Minimal exposed ports
- **Private Subnets**: Keep databases and internal services private
- **WAF**: Web Application Firewall recommended for production

### Application Security

- **Input Validation**: Strict validation using Zod schemas
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries via TypeORM
- **XSS Prevention**: React's automatic escaping + CSP headers
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Secret Management**: Environment-based with support for external vaults

### Monitoring & Compliance

- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive access logs with user, action, timestamp
- **Security Events**: Failed login attempts, permission denials
- **Metrics**: Authentication failures, rate limit hits
- **Compliance Reports**: Export audit trails for compliance review

## Security Checklist

### Development
- [ ] Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- [ ] Enable 2FA for admin accounts
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Run security linters (npm audit, safety)
- [ ] Review code for security issues

### Deployment
- [ ] Generate new secrets for production
- [ ] Enable TLS/HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up WAF rules
- [ ] Enable security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

### Operations
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Monitor security events
- [ ] Review audit logs
- [ ] Conduct security training
- [ ] Incident response plan

## Incident Response

### Detection
1. Monitor security alerts
2. Review anomalous access patterns
3. Check failed authentication spikes

### Response
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve evidence (logs, snapshots)
3. Notify security team
4. Begin investigation

### Recovery
1. Patch vulnerabilities
2. Reset compromised credentials
3. Restore from clean backups
4. Document lessons learned

## Security Headers

Configure these headers in your reverse proxy:

```nginx
# Security Headers
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';" always;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
```

## Vulnerability Reporting

Report security vulnerabilities to: security@medimetrics.example

Please include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested remediation

We aim to respond within 48 hours and provide updates on remediation progress.

## Compliance Standards

While MediMetrics implements security best practices, achieving full compliance requires:

- [ ] HIPAA Security Risk Assessment
- [ ] Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)
- [ ] Policies and Procedures documentation
- [ ] Employee training programs
- [ ] Third-party security audit
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Disaster recovery planning

## Security Tools

### Recommended Security Stack
- **WAF**: AWS WAF, Cloudflare, or ModSecurity
- **SIEM**: Splunk, ELK Stack, or AWS CloudWatch
- **Vulnerability Scanner**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
- **Dependency Scanner**: Snyk, GitHub Dependabot
- **Secret Scanner**: TruffleHog, git-secrets

### Security Testing Commands

```bash
# Dependency audit
npm audit
pip check
safety check

# OWASP ZAP scan
docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t http://localhost:3000

# TLS test
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 your-domain.com
```
