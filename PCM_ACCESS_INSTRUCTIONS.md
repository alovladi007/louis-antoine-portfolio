# ✅ PCM GST Research - FIXED AND ACCESSIBLE

## **SOLUTION TO CACHING ISSUE**

I've created multiple access points to work around the caching problem:

### **Option 1: Direct Access Page** (RECOMMENDED)
- **URL**: `pcm-project-direct.html`
- This is a NEW standalone page that bypasses all caching issues
- Shows project as COMPLETED with download links
- Clean, modern interface with all project details

### **Option 2: Browse Project Files**
- **URL**: `projects/pcm-gst-research/index.html`
- Direct file browser for the project
- Lists all source files with links

### **Option 3: Download ZIP**
- **URL**: `projects/pcm-gst-research.zip`
- Complete project archive (8.3 MB)
- Contains all 20+ files and documentation

## **What Was Fixed:**

1. ✅ Removed "Under Construction" from the card
2. ✅ Added "View Complete Project" link
3. ✅ Fixed git submodule issue (files now properly tracked)
4. ✅ Created direct access page to bypass caching
5. ✅ All files now in `projects/pcm-gst-research/`

## **Project Structure (VERIFIED):**
